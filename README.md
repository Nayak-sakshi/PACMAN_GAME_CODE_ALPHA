## PYTHON INTERN AT CODE ALPHA
### TASK-3
> During my internship in Code Alpha I was assigned to build a PACMAN GAME using Python The popular game Pacman is a fun project to build. We have to eat all the food in a maze and avoid all the ghosts that will come to eat the Pacman.
This is a nice arcade game and will require you to have knowledge of the
interacting game.
